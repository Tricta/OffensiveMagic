# Decoy With Custom Games

This is a Decoy Proof-of-Concept (PoC) designed to demonstrate how mobile threats can capture your attention and trick you into installing a malicious Magisk module.

## Attack Flow

The user is enticed with a fun or interesting feature, often shared through forums or messaging apps. Once the module is installed via Magisk, it performs unauthorized actions such as:

- Data hijacking
- Runtime code injection
- System configuration changes

## Why It Matters

This PoC highlights how entertainment and curiosity can be effectively used in social engineering attacks, particularly on rooted or developer-friendly devices.
