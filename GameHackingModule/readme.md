# Game Hacking Hooking

This is a Game Hacking Hooking Proof-of-Concept (PoC) designed to exemplify how an attacker can leverage Zygisk to hook into mobile applications at runtime. Using this method, attackers can perform targeted attacks that alter app behavior without needing physical access to the device or connecting it to a computer.

## Potential Targets
- Modifying game values (e.g., infinite coins or lives)
- Bypassing protection mechanisms
- Injecting custom logic into sensitive app functions (e.g., PIX attack on a payment flow)

## Why It Matters
This technique highlights the importance of robust runtime protection and anti-tampering measures in mobile applications, and how alternatively, these can be bypassed through Zygote Injection.
